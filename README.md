# Setting up git

## Create your own git account
Git accounts are free, please create one for yourself if you don't have one! It's the industry-standard way to share code, collaborate on others' code, and showcase your hard work. You will need to choose a user name and password. 

## Fork this repo to your own repo
Once you have created your own account, please fork this repository into your own repository on your own page using the 'fork' button at the top of this page (it looks like this:)
